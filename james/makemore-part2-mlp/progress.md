# Makemore Part 2: MLP Progress Tracker

## Video: Building makemore Part 2: MLP
**Duration:** 1h15m

**Description:** We implement a multilayer perceptron (MLP) character-level language model. In this video we also introduce many basics of machine learning (e.g. model training, learning rate tuning, hyperparameters, evaluation, train/dev/test splits, under/overfitting, etc.).

## Progress Score: 0/10
